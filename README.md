### Content We Did Not Include
   * We chose to omit broken links e.g. the IEEE Fellow link, Data Stuctures & Algorithms link
   * We did not recreate the "Key Publications" page because it linked to an external site that included lots of content
   * There were many osu sites linked under Research, Publication, Teaching, and Activities that we did not recreate pages because we decided they were not essential and wanted to focus on the more important pages with more content dirctly related to Tamal.
